Portfolio with Image Animation
This portfolio showcases a collection of images with a special hover effect. When you move your mouse over an image, it transforms in a way that makes it seem like it's changing from a sunset to a sunrise.

How it Works
The portfolio contains a set of images that have been designed to create this special effect.
When you hover your mouse over an image, it will magically transition, giving the appearance of a sunset transforming into a sunrise.
This effect is achieved by using a technique called "blend mode" combined with some strategic positioning.
How to Use
Simply open the portfolio in your web browser.
Move your mouse over any image to see the captivating transition effect.
Enjoy exploring the beautiful animations!
