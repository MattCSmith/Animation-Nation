          <h3>Genus Australopithecus</h3>
          The genus Australopithecus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million
          years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually
          becoming extinct 2 million years ago. During this time period various
          forms of australopiths existed, including Australopithecus anamensis,
          Au. afarensis, Au. sediba, and Au. africanus.
        </li>

          <h3>Homo habilis</h3>
          Homo habilis lived from about 2.8[116] to 1.4 Ma. The species evolved
          in South and East Africa in the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene,
          2.5–2 Ma, when it diverged from the australopithecines. Homo habilis
          had smaller molars and larger brains than the australopithecines, and
          made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones.
        </li>

          <h3>Homo erectus</h3>
          The first fossils of Homo erectus were discovered by Dutch physician
          Eugene Dubois in 1891 on the Indonesian island of Java. He originally
          named the material Anthropopithecus erectus (1892–1893, considered at
          this point as a chimpanzee-like fossil primate) and Pithecanthropus
          erectus (1893–1894, changing his mind as of based on its morphology,
          which he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and
          apes). Years later, in the 20th century, the German physician and
          paleoanthropologist Franz Weidenreich (1873–1948) compared in detail
          the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named Pithecanthropus
          erectus, with the characters of the Peking Man, then named
          Sinanthropus pekinensis. Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of
          their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to
          gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of
          the genus Homo, the species Homo erectus.

          <h3>Homo neanderthalensis</h3>
          Homo neanderthalensis, alternatively designated as Homo sapiens
          neanderthalensis, lived in Europe and Asia from 400,000 to about
          28,000 years ago. There are a number of clear anatomical differences
          between anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthal populations.
          Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments
          possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their surface to volume
          ratio is an extreme version of that found amongst Inuit populations,
          indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were
          AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger
          brains.

          <h3>Homo floresiensis</h3>
          Homo floresiensis, which lived from approximately 190,000 to 50,000
          years before present (BP), has been nicknamed the hobbit for its small
          size, possibly a result of insular dwarfism.[208] H. floresiensis is
          intriguing both for its size and its age, being an example of a recent
          species of the genus Homo that exhibits derived traits not shared with
          modern humans. In other words, H. floresiensis shares a common
          ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage
          and followed a distinct evolutionary path.

          <h3>Homo sapiens</h3>
          Homo sapiens (the adjective sapiens is Latin for "wise" or
          "intelligent") emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago, likely
          derived from Homo heidelbergensis or a related lineage.In September
          2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260
          CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor
          to modern humans/H. sapiens, representative of the earliest modern
          humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 260,000 and
          350,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and South
          Africa.
